To analyze options to achieve that goal, subconsultants Integral Group and Daybreak Climate Consulting developed an Excel-based GHG emissions model to inform and model policy actions for all quantified sources of GHG emissions in Portland and South Portland.The model is built on, and aligned with, the 2017 GHG inventories conducted by Integral Group and Daybreak Climate Consulting that were completed for the Cities of Portland and South Portland in 2019- 2020. Those inventories follow the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories (GPC).1 Wherever possible, modeling of future emissions has been aligned with standards in the GHG inventories to allow the cities to more easily track progress over time. Because the One Climate Future plan is for both cities, the results of the two inventories were combined and input into a single model, and baseline and projected numbers will appear larger than would be expected for either city on its own. The inventories show that both the scale and distribution of emissions between different fuels and sectors are extremely similar in both cities, with a few small exceptions: the industrial sector is larger in South Portland, and Portland has more non-road transportation infrastructure (e.g., Harbor, Jetport). Overall, combining the two inventories into a single baseline and model simplifies planning while still yielding results applicable to each city.","CH4, CO2, N20",560741,279588,,,,92,,,,,,Decreased,"Other, please specify: Overall, the emissions decreased.

In August 2020, Abington Township was selected by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) as one of 21 jurisdictions for it's Local Climate Action Program  (LCAP) (see https://www.dep.pa.gov/Citizens/climate/Pages/Local-Climate-Action.aspx ). The PA DEP contracted with ICLEI USA to provide technical assistance for the Township to create the 2018 inventory using  ICLEI ClearPath software and to draft a Climate Action Plan. The 2018 inventory was undertaken during the fall of 2020 and completed during the summer of 2021. The 2018 inventory follows the GPC protocol. Previously, through the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission (DVRPC),  the designated Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) for the Greater Philadelphia Region, the Township relied on DVRPC for its 2005, 2010, and 2015 inventories which have been annually reported to CDP by Abington Township since 2016. DVRPC conducts regional Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories  on a 5-year interval using its own methodology. A detailed guide outlining the methods and data sources used for DVRPC’s 2015 Energy Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions in Greater Philadelphia, may be viewed at https://www.dvrpc.org/Reports/TM18023.pdf.
