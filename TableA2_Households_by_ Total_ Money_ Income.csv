"1 A margin of error (MOE) is a measure of an estimate's variability. The larger the MOE in relation to the size of the estimate, the less reliable the estimate. This number, when added to and subtracted from the estimate, forms the 90 percent confidence interval. MOEs shown in this table are based on standard errors calculated using replicate weights beginning with 2010.

Of those who reported only one race, being Hispanic was reported by 16.6 percent of White householders, 5.6 percent of Black householders, 2.9 percent of Asian householders and and 29.7 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native householders. Data users should exercise caution when interpreting aggregate results for the Hispanic population and for race groups because these populations consist of many distinct groups that differ in socioeconomic characteristics, culture, and recency of immigration. Data were first collected for Hispanics in 1972.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
